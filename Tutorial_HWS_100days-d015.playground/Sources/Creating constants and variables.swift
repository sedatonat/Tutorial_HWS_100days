import Cocoa

//  Swift can create constants and variables, but constants are generally preferable.

//  Use this to create then change a variable string:

var name = "Ted"
name = "Rebecca"
//  If you donâ€™t want to change a value, use a constant instead:

let user = "Daphne"
//  The print() function is helpful for learning and debugging, and shows some information about a variable:
print(user)
